## Serverside

- Think of this like tiny app
- When a user goes to a site, the site will pull ALL the data from a server and give it to the user

## Clientside

- When a user goes to a site, the site will pull INFORMATION about the site then afterwards use that information to render the site

## General Rule

- Everything should be Serverside if possible, if you need to use REACT hooks then make a component to use that hook and make that component client side but writing "use client"
